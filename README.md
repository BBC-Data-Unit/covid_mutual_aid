Mutual aid community groups set up to help those isolated due to coronavirus

In March 2020, the BBC Shared Data unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51978388) reported that nearly 1,000 mutual aid groups had been set up since the outbreak of coronavirus.

The data from Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK was also updated to reflect a growing number of mutual aid groups in the week after publication.

Tens of thousands of people had come forward offering to pick up shopping or deliver medicine to the most vulnerable.

The list of support groups was geocoded and matched to local authority area and UK region, published [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bWIuq_jYKOeSYSu-FswUVzRsxrEtS4PsQ1ESeSjuzMs/edit).

A map was also released of the geocoded groups on gmaps, as an accompanying visualisation [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Zw8VsaNNMd4iLS77xUOQ8b13REDLYT34&ll=52.36809576613088%2C-2.8830537323111685&z=5).
